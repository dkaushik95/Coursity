Software Engineering,34000,"When the first digital computers appeared in the early 1940 [9] the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine. Practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the ""stored program architecture"" or von Neumann architecture. Thus the division between ""hardware"" and ""software"" began with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity of computing.",Mr. Ron Brook,4,,
Artificial Intelligence,20000,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science an ideal ""intelligent"" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.",Ms. Karen Bill,4,,
Programming with Java,13000,"Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment.",Mr. Robert D’souza,3,,
Introduction to Python,20000,"Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.[24][25] Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.[26][27] The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.",Mr. Steve Gates,3,,
Operating Systems,22000,An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function.,Mr. Bill Jobs,4,,
Ruby on Rails,50000,"Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.",Ms. Poorva Dixit,4,,
